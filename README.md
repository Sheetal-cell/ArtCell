🎨✨ Welcome to ArtCell! ✨🎨
Hey there 👋!
I’m Sheetal Bajaj, and this is my fun little project called ArtCell — a pixel-based drawing app made using Python, Tkinter, and Pillow.

If you love doodling with colors, creating pixel art, or just need a fun way to de-stress while coding, you’ll enjoy this one! 🎨🖌️

🖼️ What is ArtCell?
ArtCell is like a mini digital canvas where every cell (pixel) is your playground.
You can pick colors, paint, erase, save your art, and even load old designs. Think of it like an MS Paint for pixel artists!

🚀 What Can You Do Here?
Here’s everything you can try inside ArtCell:

🎨 Pick your favorite color from a color picker
🌈 Turn on Rainbow Mode to surprise yourself with random colors
✏️ Use the Eraser Tool to clean up individual pixels
🗑️ Clear Canvas to wipe your masterpiece clean in one click
💾 Save your canvas as a PNG image
📖 Load saved images back into the canvas anytime

🛠️ Tech Used
Python 3
Tkinter for the GUI
Pillow (PIL) for image saving & loading

🎯 How To Run It?
1️⃣ Download or clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/sheetalbajaj04/ArtCell.git
cd ArtCell

2️⃣ Install the only required library (if you don’t have it yet)

pip install pillow
3️⃣ Run the app!
python artcell.py
That’s it — you’re ready to draw 🎨✨

🎉  What It Looks Like
👉 A colorful grid where each tiny square is clickable — let your creativity loose!

💡 What’s Next?
I’m already thinking of adding:

🔲 Brush size options
🔳 Grid size adjustments
🎨 Pre-made color palettes
↩️ Undo/Redo feature
🎞️ Save your creations as GIF animations

Got ideas? Drop them in the comments or message me — would love to collab!
